# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 19, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Solved two Project Euler problems, Started bashxl
Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Link to work:** [bashxl](https://github.com/bsipin20/bashxl)

**Thoughts:** 
Focused on writting working Project Euler code without thinking of best practices. In future write in comments how solution works with space and time (todo). Write ways to improve (e.g. p001.py could have used generators). 
bashxl seems like a good first side project. Helps me focus on building packages, documentation, command line arguments. 

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
